We observed the field of GRB 220623A (Sbarufatti et al., GCN 32243) using the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC imager. Two sets of observations were acquired in the r and z filters, with mid times 2022 Jun 23.890 and 23.903 UT (14.3 and 14.6 hr after the trigger, respectively). The exposure times were 3x300 and 5x200 s in r and z, respectively. No source is detected in our images within or close to the GRB XRT position (Evans et al., GCN 32248), down to the following 3-sigma limits: r > 23.4 (AB); z > 22.5 (AB). Flux calibration was carried out against nearby stars from the Pan-STARRS catalog.
